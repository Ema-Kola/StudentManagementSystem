# Student Management System

This Student Management System is designed to support the needs of a university's diverse user base, which includes students, academic staff, and administrative staff. This system facilitates a wide range of functionalities to meet specific user needs: students can access their transcripts, grades, and attendance records, manage course selections, request documents, and engage with student clubs; academic staff can manage course materials, record grades and attendance, and access student surveys; and administrative staff can handle tasks such as syllabus review, course creation, timetable management, tuition fee updates, and disciplinary records. 

The Student Management System ensures secure, role-based access and compliance with privacy and data protection regulations. By providing an efficient, user-friendly interface and ensuring data integrity and security, the System Management System aims to make university operations as efficient as possible, enhance communication and collaboration, and improve the overall educational experience.

The primary users of this system include:

**Students**: This category includes both current students and alumni. Current students require extensive interaction with the system for their academic and extracurricular activities, while alumni need access primarily for viewing their academic records.

**Academic Staff**: This group includes main lecturers, advisors, and assistant lecturers who need to manage course materials, grades, attendance, and student surveys.

**Administrative Staff**: This category comprises various administrative roles such as Head of Departments, coordinators, finance office staff, Dean of Students office, registrar's office, and IT office staff, each responsible for specific administrative functions.
